## üìÅ File Structure

After setup, you should have:

```
FrenchNovelProcessor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.json     ‚Üê Downloaded from Google Cloud Console
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ token.json          ‚Üê Auto-generated after first authorization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Important:**
- ‚úÖ `credentials.json` - Keep this file secure, don't share publicly
- ‚úÖ `token.json` - Generated after first auth, can be regenerated
- üö´ Never commit these files to Git (they're in .gitignore)

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "credentials.json not found"

**Solution:**
- Make sure you downloaded the credentials file
- Rename it exactly to `credentials.json`
- Place it in the project root (same level as README.md)

### "Access denied" or "Permission denied"

**Solution:**
- Make sure you enabled both APIs (Sheets + Drive)
- Check OAuth consent screen configuration
- Verify you added your email as a test user
- Try deleting `token.json` and re-authenticating

### "This app isn't verified"

**This is normal!** Your app is in development mode.

**To proceed:**
1. Click **"Advanced"**
2. Click **"Go to French Novel Processor (unsafe)"**
3. Grant permissions

**To verify your app (optional):**
- Required if you want to publish publicly
- Not necessary for personal use

### Browser doesn't open for authorization

**Solution:**
1. Copy the URL from terminal
2. Open it manually in your browser
3. Complete authorization
4. Return to terminal

### "Invalid grant" or "Token expired"

**Solution:**
- Delete `token.json`
- Run the application again
- Re-authorize when prompted

---

## üîí Security Notes

### What these credentials do:

**credentials.json:**
- Identifies your application to Google
- Contains client ID and client secret
- Required to request authorization

**token.json:**
- Contains your personal authorization
- Allows the app to access YOUR Google account
- Can be revoked at any time

### How to revoke access:

1. Go to [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Find "French Novel Processor"
3. Click **"Remove Access"**
4. Delete `token.json` from your project

### Best practices:

- ‚úÖ Keep `credentials.json` secure
- ‚úÖ Don't share `token.json`
- ‚úÖ Add both files to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Regenerate if compromised
- ‚ùå Don't commit to public repositories
- ‚ùå Don't share on forums or chat

- [Google Drive API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api)
- [OAuth 2.0 Guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

### Common Issues

1. **Quota exceeded**
   - Default: 100 requests/100 seconds/user
   - Solution: Throttle requests, increase quota
